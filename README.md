📁 Portfolio Website #1 – Full Stack Intro Project

Welcome! This project is my first full-stack portfolio website build, designed as a learning exercise and proof of concept. It represents my initial attempt at integrating a custom frontend with a modern backend stack.

🔧 Tech Stack Overview
🎨 Frontend

Node.js + Bootstrap
Used to build a responsive and lightweight UI with reusable components and server-side rendering.

🧠 Backend

Python + Django
The backend is powered by Django, handling routing, logic, and database integration.

🌐 Deployment

Nginx
Configured as a reverse proxy to serve both the frontend and backend securely and efficiently.

🎯 Purpose

This project was built to:

Practice deploying a full-stack app from scratch

Understand how to bridge a Node.js-based frontend with a Python Django backend

Set up a real-world Nginx deployment pipeline

Create a foundation I can build on in future projects
